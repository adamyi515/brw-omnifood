Following a tutorial to refresh my memory on Responsive Website Development. 

This tutorial creates a website for a fake Food Service company. The course covers variety of topics such as:

1. Best practices for structuring the site using HTML and using conventional class names using BEM methodology (block, element, modifier)
2. Organize multiple CSS files in their respective files/sections.
3. Practice using GITHUB/GIT for version control.
4. Basic Web design:
 - 9 Ingredients (Typography, Color, Images/Illustrations, Box-shadows, Icons, Border-radius, Spacing/whitespace, Visual Hierarchy, Components/layouts)
 - Website personalities
5. Basic Media Queries (Desktop first vs Mobile first concepts)
